{"name":"RODA","body":"***\r\n\r\n\r\n**This page and the GitHub source code are under construction!** \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# About\r\nIn mid 2006, the Portuguese National Archives launched a project called RODA – Repository of Authentic Digital Objects – aiming at identifying and bringing together all the necessary technology, human resources and political support to carry out long-term preservation of digital materials. As part of the original goals of the project, RODA was the development of a digital repository capable of ingesting, managing and providing continuous access to various types of digital objects produced by national public institutions.\r\n\r\nThe end result was a powerful repository able to ingest and preserve text documents, images, video, audio and relational databases in many different formats. RODA automatically normalizes ingested data to preservation formats; implements a powerful and extensible preservation event scheduling mechanism; includes various data viewers for all supported representations; offers advanced user management and control; provides statistics; and much more.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the repository is supported by open-source technologies (Fedora Commons, JBoss, Web services, etc.) and is based on existing standards such as OAIS, EAD, METS and PREMIS. \r\n\r\n# Demo site\r\nTo experience RODA, please visit the **demo site** (http://demo.roda-community.org) where you can:\r\n\r\n* Login as consumer to browse and search documents;\r\n* Login as producer to send new documents to be ingested;\r\n* Login as archivist to check documents conformity, accept/reject submitted documents, create and manage collections, change object permissions and much more;\r\n* Login as administrator to gain access to user management, task management, global statistics and reports, search logs, etc.\r\n\r\n# Download and development\r\nWe are moving to GitHub, but you can access the current development site at:\r\n\r\nhttp://redmine.keep.pt/projects/roda-public/wiki\r\n\r\nIn the current site you can:\r\n* Download RODA binary and source\r\n* Request free pre-installed RODA Virtual Machine\r\n* Browse existing documentation\r\n* Create and browse current issues\r\n* Talk in RODA forums\r\n\r\n# Adicional services\r\n\r\nKEEP SOLUTIONS is a portuguese company that provides the following services on RODA:\r\n\r\n* **Installation:** Hardware and software installation for a production level solution, with customization of the interfaces to your own design and graphical identity.\r\n* **Maintenance:** Hardware and software maintenance of the solution for any problem that might appear\r\n* **Support:** Develop new features in RODA by request\r\n* **Training:** Training sessions for RODA administrators, archivists and producers","tagline":"Repository of Authentic Digital Objects","google":"UA-31525916-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
