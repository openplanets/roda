<h1>About</h1>

<p>In mid 2006, the Portuguese National Archives launched a project called RODA – Repository of Authentic Digital Objects – aiming at identifying and bringing together all the necessary technology, human resources and political support to carry out long-term preservation of digital materials. As part of the original goals of the project, RODA was the development of a digital repository capable of ingesting, managing and providing continuous access to various types of digital objects produced by national public institutions.</p>

<p>The end result was a powerful repository able to ingest and preserve text documents, images, video, audio and relational databases in many different formats. RODA automatically normalizes ingested data to preservation formats; implements a powerful and extensible preservation event scheduling mechanism; includes various data viewers for all supported representations; offers advanced user management and control; provides statistics; and much more.</p>

<p>Additionally, the repository is supported by open-source technologies (Fedora Commons, JBoss, Web services, etc.) and is based on existing standards such as OAIS, EAD, METS and PREMIS. </p>
